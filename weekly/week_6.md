# 2019/06/10 - 2019/06/16

* Submitted a [PR](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pull/2963) on adding side-effects field to Webhooks to support Kubernetes API Dry Runs.

* Discussed with members from the Istio & Kiali team on the possible approaches and their sugggestions to support Istio.

* Istio having a large number of integration points it was hard to choose a way to integrate with SMI. Came down to 2 approaches that we can take and started working on a POC as per the suggestion from mentor.
